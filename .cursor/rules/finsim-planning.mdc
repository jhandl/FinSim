When asked to plan something, write the plan to an .md file. Don't touch any code, don't start implementing it until explicitly told to do so. 

The plan should be a clear, concise, and definitive guide for implementation. It should not include commentary of the evolution of the plan. The target audience is both the user (so they can review it) and an AI assistant coder.

Start with a high level plan. Then go into detail, but first take time to find the parts of the system that will be involved, read the relevant code, understand how it works, what each variable does.

The implementation details should describe the change, but not provide explicit code if possible. Let the coder figure that out. But do include detailed instructions when necessary (for example naming existing variables and functions to nudge the coder to use them). Make sure you are aware of any similar code in the project. Don't reinvent the wheel. Keep it simple and elegant.

The plan should include a way to track progress and instructions about updating the progress as tasks are completed. When new information comes along during the implementation, the plan should be checked for correctness, consistency and completeness.

DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN UNLESS EXPLICITLY TOLD TO DO SO.
