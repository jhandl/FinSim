Always read [AGENTS.md](mdc:AGENTS.md) to understand the project. Never assume how the code works, always read the relevant source code files to understand the code. When implementing a change, do it in the most elegant, no-nonsense way possible,while not being overly verbose (don't create unnecessary one-time-use helper methods) and strictly adhering to the way the existing code already works. No hacks please.

The user is always running a local webserver, so there's no need to start a new one to run some UI tests.
