## TESTING ##

When asked to create a test of something, there's two possibilities:

### Blackbox testing ### 

To do unit tests and integration tests, you can use the existing testing framework. Read the @AGENTS.md doc, use the @TestUtils.js and use @TestBasicSalaryTax.js as a template.

### Frontend testing ###

For testing the frontend, we use Playwright. Read the @frontend-testing.md doc, use the @FrontendTestUtils.js and use @TestExpenseWizardNavigation.spec.js as a template.
