## CODING ##

When implementing a change, do it in the most elegant, no-nonsense way possible, while not being overly verbose (don't create unnecessary one-time-use helper methods), and strictly adhere to the way the existing code already works. NO HACKS!

After you finished making a change and the user is happy with it, consider updating AGENTS.md if the change is significant enough. The update should either keep the file consistent with the code, or add a high-level and concise description of the new code. There should be no commentary of the evolution of the file.
