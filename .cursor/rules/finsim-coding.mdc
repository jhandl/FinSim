## CODING ##

When implementing a change, do it in the most elegant, no-nonsense way possible, with the absolute minimum amount of code possible, and strictly adhere to the way the existing code already works. Don't add code if you can reuse existing code. Don't add code if you can modify existing code. NO HACKS!

After you finished making a change and the user is happy with it, consider updating AGENTS.md if the change is significant enough. The update should either keep the file consistent with the code, or add a high-level and concise description of the new code. There should be no commentary of the evolution of the file.

A local webserver is always running, so there's never need to start a new one to. DO NOT ASK THE USER TO RUN A SERVER. IT'S ALWAYS ALREADY RUNNING!
