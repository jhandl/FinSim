// Gen-AI Coder Prompt:
// "Create a test named 'Real Estate Transaction' that validates property purchase, appreciation, and sale. 
// Set up parameters: standard tax rates, starting age 30. 
// Add events: purchase €400,000 house at age 35 with 3% annual appreciation, sell at age 65. 
// Assert that: property value grows at 3% annually, sale proceeds reflect 30 years of appreciation,
