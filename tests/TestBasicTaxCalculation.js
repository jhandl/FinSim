/* Basic Salary Tax Calculation Test
 * 
 * Gen-AI Coder Prompt: "Create a test named 'Basic Salary Tax Calculation' that validates 
 * income tax, PRSI, and USC calculations for a single individual. Set up parameters: 
 * startingAge=30, targetAge=35, no initial assets. Add events: €50,000 annual salary 
 * from age 30-34. Assert that: income tax calculations match expected Irish tax bands, 
 * PRSI is 4% of income, USC is calculated correctly, and net income equals gross minus all taxes."
 *
 * This test validates the core Irish tax system calculations including:
 * - Income Tax (20% standard rate, €44,000 standard rate band for 2025)
 * - PRSI (4% for employees)
 * - USC (Universal Social Charge) on graduated bands
 * - Personal tax credit (€2,000 for 2025)
 * - PRSI tax credit (€12 for 2025)
