/* Dual State Pensions Test
 *
 * This test validates comprehensive state pension calculations for two people who reach
 * the state pension qualifying age at different times due to age differences.
 * Enhanced with comprehensive test cases migrated from the original test suite covering
 * pension eligibility, timing, age-related increases, and individual vs combined calculations.
