// Gen-AI Coder Prompt:
// "Create a test named 'Pension Contribution Validation' that validates pension contributions and employer matching. 
// Set up parameters: 30% pension contribution rate, 6% employer match, 5% pension growth. 
// Add events: â‚¬60,000 salary with 6% employer match from age 30-34. 
// Assert that: pension contributions equal 30% of salary, employer contributions equal 6% of salary, 
// pension fund grows by expected compound amount, and salary income is reduced by personal contribution amount."
