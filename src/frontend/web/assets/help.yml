      items:
        - question: "Why are the numbers much larger than I expected?"
          answer:
            - "Unless you specify 0 inflation, the numbers will grow year after year at the rate of inflation."
            - "The values you enter into the different fields have to be in terms of present value though. For example, for a property that you expect to purchase 10 years from now, you should enter the current value of the property, not the value you expect it to be worth in 10 years time."
            - "If you prefer to see all values in today's terms without the inflation growth, enable the Present Value toggle in the menu (☰). This will automatically adjust all displayed amounts for inflation, making them easier to understand and compare."
        - question: "Why are tax credits and limits also inflation adjusted?"
          answer:
            - "Even though some of the budget numbers don't change every year (cough, cgt credit, cough), many generally do, for example the income tax brackets."
            - "I have to assume some periodic adjustment, and inflation is the best proxy I can think of. I'm open to suggestions on how to do this better."
        - question: "What is Present Value display and how do I use it?"
          answer:
            - "Present Value display shows all projected amounts (income, expenses, investments, taxes, etc.) in today's currency terms by adjusting for inflation. This makes it easier to understand what future amounts will actually be worth in real purchasing power."
            - "Instead of seeing inflated nominal amounts (e.g., €500,000 salary in 30 years), you see what that amount is worth in today's euros (e.g., €200,000 in real terms). This helps you compare values across different years and understand the true impact of your financial decisions."
            - "You can enable Present Value display using the toggle in the menu (☰). When enabled, all values in the data table and charts are automatically deflated to show their present-value equivalents. Toggle it off to see the original nominal (inflated) values."
            - "Note that the simulation calculations remain the same - only the display changes. Your CSV exports will always contain nominal values for accuracy."
        - question: "Why do I see this unexpected number in the simulation data table?"
          answer:
            - "Many of the table cells have a little 'i' on the lower right corner. That means that the cell has a tooltip attached to it." 
            - "You can hover (or long-press) over the number to see where the number comes from."
        - question: "How do I use the Events table?"
          answer:
            - "Things that have a start date and an end date, like your income, your expenses or buying a property, go into the events table."
            - "Click \"Add Event\" and choose the type. You can hover (or long-press) on any type in the menu to see a description of what it does."
        - question: "How do I model property purchases?"
          answer:
            - "Use the \"Real Estate\" event type. Enter a name for the property, the down payment, purchase date (which can be in the past), expected sale date (leave it blank if you won't sell it), and the expected appreciation rate."
            - "Then create a \"Mortgage\" event with the same name and start date, then enter the yearly mortgage repayment, end date and the interest rate."
            - "You can add multiple properties to your plan."
        - question: "What if I want to buy a property in cash?"
          answer:
            - "You can enter the full purchase price and not add a mortgage event for that property."
        - question: "Can couples use this together?"
          answer:
            - "Yes! Toggle to \"Two-Person Mode\" using the {icon:user-friends} icon. This allows separate incomes, pensions, and retirement ages."
            - "The simulator will optimize tax efficiency between partners and model joint financial planning."
        - question: "What is Monte Carlo simulation?"
          answer:
            - "When in Variable Growth mode, your scenario runs thousands of times with random variations in investment returns."
            - "The simulator then counts what percentage of those runs were successful (i.e. reached your target age without running out of money)."
            - "The result shows the probability of success of your scenario and gives you an idea of the range of possible outcomes."
        - question: "How do find the critical points in my plan?"
          answer:
            - "Use the color schemes ({icon:palette}) in the simulation data table to understand where your plan tends to fail." 
        - question: "How accurate are the projections?"
          answer:
            - "The projections are estimates based on your inputs and assumptions about future economic conditions. Not a prediction of the future."
        - question: "Is my financial data secure?"
          answer:
            - "Yes, all your financial data stays on your computer or phone. It's not sent to any server or stored online."
            - "If you don't save it before closing this browser tab, it will be lost."

In contrast, [in 2022 it rose to 8.2%](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cpi/consumerpriceindexdecember2022/){inflation,consumer price index,CPI,2022,annual}, the highest since 1984.
