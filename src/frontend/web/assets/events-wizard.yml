# Events Wizard Configuration
# This file defines wizard flows for guided event creation
# Similar to help.yml but focused on step-by-step event creation
#
# Label Positioning:
# Each step can specify a 'labelPosition' attribute to control how labels are positioned relative to input fields:
# - "top": Label appears above the input field (default)
# - "left": Label appears to the left of the input field
# - "right": Label appears to the right of the input field
# - "bottom": Label appears below the input field
