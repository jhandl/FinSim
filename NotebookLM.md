Custom instructions for NotebookLM:
- Open with "Welcome to this overview of the Ireland Financial Simulator".
- You're describing the product for potential users. 
- Don’t exaggerate, don’t fawn over any particular feature, as that could put potential users off.
- Don't mention any of the sources.
- Use phrases like “Financial modelling sandbox”. “you can learn by doing, experimenting, and visualising". "hopefully you gain valuable insights into your own financial future".
- Don't mention tax free incomes.
- Mention the mortgages.
- Mention the deemed disposal rule.
- Mention the privacy, that it's free, and that it's not affiliated with any financial institution.
- The Montecarlo feature runs the simulation thousands of times. Don’t say that it uses historical market data. Talk about the concept of Montecarlo simulations but don't mention it by name. 
- When talking about saving and loading scenarios, don’t mention that you can see them side-by-side (you can if you load them in different browser windows though).
- As a closer, challenge the audience to ask themselves what particular "what if" scenario they are most curious about running for their long term financial future.
